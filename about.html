            <p> In December 2024, I completed my most recent degree with a Masters in Science in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. I started the program in Fall 2022 and my concentration was in Computing systems. Over the course of the program, I took classes in topics ranging from <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7638-robotics-ai-techniques> Artifical Intelligence for Robotics </a> to <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading> Machine Learning for Trading </a>. I was able to take various other classes to help build my foundational knowledge in topics ranging from <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks> Computer Networks </a> to <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6400-database-systems-concepts-and-design> Database Systems </a> to <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6035-introduction-information-security> Information Security </a>. With my concentration, I also had the opportunity to take a class focused entirely on development and analysis of <a href = https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms> Algorithms </a>. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> I truly enjoyed the program and completed my journey with a 4.0 GPA. While many of the courses were in Python, I had the opportunity also program with Java, C++, C, and SQL. 
            </p>

            <p> For my undergraduate education, I studied Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. In addition to my major, I had two certificates in Applications of Computing (Computer Science) and Robotics & Intelligent Systems. Note: at Princeton, a certificate is the equivalent of a minor. 
            <br>
            Through my undergraduate education, the two first classes in Computer Science were taught in Java. The third class was foundationally in C (with some fun assembly language tossed in there) with the remainder classes primarily in Java or Python. Through engineering labs, I was introduced to Python. Since my first introduction to how user-friendly Python programming can be, the Python language has been my go-to for personal projects that I want to immediately get up and running!

            <h2> Personal Life </h2>
            <p> Since 2021, I have lived in South Jersey. I am always taking on a new project such as learning how to program in Swift to develop an app or creating a lightsaber that changes color based on how my stock portfolio is currently performing. I love learning, problem solving, and developing elegant and clean solutions to messy problems. </p>
